# OTVision

OTVision is a core module of the [OpenTrafficCam framework](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam) to detect and track objects (road users) in videos recorded by [OTCamera](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTCamera) or other camera systems. On the resulting trajectories, one can perform traffic analysis using [OTAnalytics](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics).

Check out the [documentation](https://opentrafficcam.org/OTVision/) for detailed instructions on how to install and use OTVision.

We appreciate your support in the form of both code and comments. First, please have a look at the [contribute](https://opentrafficcam.org/contribute) section of the OpenTrafficCam documentation.
